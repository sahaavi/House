## Acknowledgments

This project was built by following the steps provided in the book "[Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781491962282/)" by [Aurélien Géron](https://github.com/ageron). The book provided clear and detailed explanations of each step, along with practical tips and best practices, and it used popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow to implement the code.
